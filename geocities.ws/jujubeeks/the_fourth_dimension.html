	<td colspan=7 rowspan=1 width=647><span style="font-size:14">I believe that the fourth dimension is not time, because if it were, then we could go both ways into it, and we could go back in time. Let's use an analogy: The second dimension is a plane. The second dimension more than likely bends into the third dimension. Therefore the first dimension bends into the second dimension. The first dimension couldn't bend both ways into the third dimension, because it is so much greater (not better, just greater) than the first dimension. The first dimension could also bend into the fourth dimension, but not likely. The first dimension (not using correct logic for some reason) bends also one way into the fifth dimension. The second dimension could bend into the fourth dimension, but only one way. It also could only bend one way, as well as in the fifth dimension. Every dimension (including the zeroth dimension, but not including negative dimensions) runs one and only one way into the fifth dimension (unless it is a higher dimension). I never exactly explained the fourth dimension correctly, so lets use another analogy. The zeroth dimension is a dot. Nothing more, nothing less. Only one (if that) creature exists in this dimension, and it takes up the whole dimension. It does not eat, nor does it need to. It does not drink because it doesn't need to. It doesen't think or do anything because it does not need to. It can only exist. This does not mean that the dot is small, it just means it takes up the zeroth dimension. If we add a perpendicular direction, we get a line. Many creatures live on this line. They can only move along the line though. They could keep moving until they hit the end of the line, or another creature, and then keep going in the opposite direction, unless it somehow consumed the dot on the line. This line could be miles long and could not be straight, but the creatures would not know left and right or up and down, they could only imagine that they were moving in those directions if they could use logic. The second dimension adds a perpendicular direction. The second dimension is a plane. If a sphere entered the dimension, a creature there would only see a small circle expanding and then shrinking until it disappeared. If a three dimensional creature was operating on a two dimensional creature with a two dimensional brain tumor, the three dimensional creature could easily move its hand into the patient, remove the tumor, and never have to cut open or operate. The two dimensional would be lucky to have such a friend. The second dimension could bend both ways into the third dimension like the first could bend into the second. Now for the third dimension. We live in this dimension. Some people believe we live in the fourth dimension but my belief is that we live in the third dimension. This dimension is the most complex dimension that a normal human being could percept. We live, breathe, eat, drink, and exist in this dimension. A normal three dimensional creature such as myself could not float of into the fourth dimension if I wanted a shortcut to my friends house. I could not move equally away from the sides of a sphere. I could not do this because I never could, will, and do. My body could travel into the fourth dimension if I had a fourth dimensional friend, but I could die because of the greatness of that dimension. Even if I could survive, I never could perceive this and I would just look invisible to others. I still haven't explained what the fourth dimension is yet, so since I am here, I will explain. The fourth dimension is space. Not space like up beyond the sky, but a spatial dimension that exceeds ours. If you were fourth dimensional, you would most likely look like odd three dimensional shapes, or possibly bags of skin with irregular shape. If you wanted to kill me, and you were a hundred miles away, you could (possibly) teleport through the fourth dimension (because we bend into it) and remove my lungs from my body, all the meanwhile while watching TV if you desired. Now for the fifth dimension, also known as Time (after a quick overview of unmentioned things). The zeroth dimension is a dot, the first is a line, second a square (or represented by as all higher dimensions are also), the third a cube, the fourth (called a) hypercube (some people call it a tesseract, but I think that that is wrong as you will see in a few seconds), and the fifth a tesseract. The relationship of these shapes is that a perpendicular direction is added. In the fifth dimension, the multiverse is a huge cube or sphere (no one knows what the shape of the multiverse is shaped like) and there are infinity multiverses. All the same, except every one is a yottosecond. There are almost infinity boxes (that is what I will call them) and for each one, it represents yottosecond (or some people believe it isn't that exact, its just a second) in time that repeats its short self in a loop infinity times. You could travel between each as fast or as slow as you wanted. There are some unexplained paradoxes that follow the theory of the fifth dimension. The grandfather paradox for example (by the way, if you don't know already, a paradox is something that is true and false at the same time, and doesn't make sense because it is true and false, such as this: THIS STATEMENT IS FALSE. If it is false, it is true, but it says it is false, which means its true, which means its false, and so on and so forth, or this: Is the answer to this question no? There is no answer... If you say no, than that means no, it's not no meaning it is yes, unlike you said, but if it is yes, then it's no. If you say yes, then that's &quot;yes it is no, meaning its no, meaning its yes&quot;. The opposite of this is something that is always true, such as: THIS STATMENT IS TRUE. If it is true, its true to true, meaning its true, like I said, or: Is the answer to this question yes? If you reply yes, that means yes it is yes like you said. If you say no, then that is &quot;No, it is not yes, meaning it's no like I said.). If you killed your grandfather as a child, he would not marry your grandmother and you would be missing a parent, meaning that you never existed, but if you never existed, how could you kill your grandfather?! (This is explained in Futurama, when Fry kills his grandfather back in time because he accidentally traveled through a wormhole. Then he gets his grandmother pregnant and his father is eventually born. Then he is born out of odd coincidence). If a paradox happened that would cease the existence of something, it could also open up a black hole or a wormhole that could destroy the universe (also explained in Futurama). Now for the sixth dimension (represented by a hyper-tesseract). The sixth dimension is explained as the universe, or possibly be the multiverse. Not much is known about what is in this dimension or beyond. We just theorize based on earlier logical analogies. The seventh dimension (which no one has a name for what it is represented by, but what I call the hyper-hyper-tesseract) is (based on theory) heaven and hell. God is supposedly a Seventh dimensional creature. A Seven (not seventh because I think only God is a seventh dimensional creature) dimensional creature (God) has powers beyond any limit. Since based on theory, there is no eighth dimension, God is the highest dimensional creature, meaning that he created all, and has control over all. Now for the multiverse that I was mentioning before. I believe that it goes like this (from smallest to largest): Light Particle, Neutrino, Neutron, Atom, Molecule, Compound, Organelle, Cell, Tissue, Organ, Organ System, Being, Family, Home, Neighborhood, City, State, Country, Continent, World, Solar System, Galaxy, Universe, and finally the Multiverse (and maybe holoverse... I dont know yet...). In every multiverse, there is an alternate universe in which something or many things are different just slightly or possibly large. There are infinity universes all contained in the multiverse (some call it the holoverse, but I'm not sure that that is accurate). Anything you could imagine in every universe. One where there is the slightest difference of where you just own a dollar more, or even a large difference such as you and anyone that you were ever related to is dead. I also believe that the universe ends somewhere, just that it is so huge, that no one could ever reach the end, even if they could travel a thousillian light-years a yottosecond for 1 thousillian years. I also believe that instead of traveling fast, you could travel through a wormhole, that connects two universes through the fourth dimension. I believe that a black hole could also connect somewhere, but no one could get past it. I believe that when you are sucked into a black hole, you keep expanding until you get into a negative dimension in which nothing exists and you would remain with out existing, creating a paradox that would destroy the black hole, but since nothing could get out of the black hole, and since it weighs negative weight, it couldn't be destroyed creating another paradox, and another. In the end (or in simpler words) you would be killed. Now like I just said, a black hole weighs negative weight. Any kind of hole in space weighs negative weight, because it sucks thing into itself and it has no gravity. </span></td>
