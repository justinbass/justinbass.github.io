	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=650><span style="font-size:14">Now for more on paradoxes. If you read my long paragraph on paradoxes, you know what they are. Another way to explain how a paradox could work out is the alternate universe theory. If a paradox happens in a point in time, an alternate universe is created. Lets say that I tried to stop Martin Luther King Jr. from being killed. If I tried, I certainly would not have appeared in the newspaper, so I would have created an alternate dimension in which I existed before I actually did. This theory could also be wrong, such as this: What happens if that theory is not true, and I actually did go back in time. The newspapers would not say so, and no article would probably mention it. So, there could be an event that nobody had ever seen, such as me going back in time, Preventing the shooter from killing Martin Luther King Jr, his brother killing Martin, and me brainwashing everyone in the room.<br>That would be unlikely though... Ok, for another unexplained thing: Negative Dimensions. If the third dimension is a cube, second a square, first a line, and zeroth a dot, then how can you take away a perpendicular line from a dot? Its like getting a GPA of -1, or playing basketball and getting a score of -14. It basically impossible unless you can imagine. I believe that going into a negative dimension would erase your existence (since theoretically it doesn't exist). This also creates another paradox... You ceasing your existence by going into a place that doesn't (theoretically) exist, means you went to a place that you cant go to. This is why you can't get inside a black hole and get out unharmed. Another paradox is formed also: If the negative first dimension doesn't exist, than how can you get into it? In fact, how can I even be explaining that something doesn't exist, when if it doesn't exist, I don't know about it, and I couldn't know that it doesn't exist, which I do. If your brain just died, don't worry. I went kind of fast. There is another paradox that I forgot to explain: What happens if there is an alternate universe in which they could and wanted to destroy the multiverse. That would be possible for them, and we would not exist right now. This is why I believe that there are several (mabye infinite) multiverses, and no alternate universe that could interfere with other multiverses. I don't have a name for the place holding the multiverses, but I will use Holoverse. By the way, I got the word &quot;Holoverse&quot; from www.themysteryoftimeandspace.com or www.albartus.com/motas on level twelve in the book located in the room with all of the movable furniture.<br>I thought up a paradox that is uneasily explained. Since you die and go to heaven or hell, or have your soul move on, you can't just cease from all existance (like going into a negative dimension from a black hole, but since no one has ever reported anything on the inside of black holes and lived to tell it I might not now how that works either...). Since you can't cease from existance, you can't go back in time or go to another universe etc. because that would create a paradox, and that would mess up the holoverse itself. Paradoxes that are really big do not exist. This means that no 5th dimensional creature can exist. </span></td>
